 * # Immutable Events
 A core tenet of the LUSID platform is the concept of an immutable data store.  This gives the ability to consistently reproduce the state of the system for any given point in bi-temporal space.  In order to achieve this LUSID has implemented an append only event store for all data types.  New events, including historical amendments, are added to the end of the event stream and then played back in order to construct the state.  Given that all the events from T0 are required in order to reconstruct the state, there can be significant computational complexity and cost involved.  FINBOURNE have employed a number of techniques and optimisations in order to produce consistent performance characteristics e.g. using snapshots which has resulted in a highly performance and scalable platform.
 # Scope
 All entities within LUSID live within a logical partitioning of data know as a scope.  Any given entity can only live within one scope and is addressable with a unique identifier.
 For example, prices for equities from different vendors may be uploaded into different scopes such as `client/vendor1` and `client/vendor2`.  A portfolio may then be valued using either of the price sources by referencing the appropriate scope.
 It should be noted that scopes are not hierarchical and 2 different scopes which may contain the same path elements do not have any relationship.
 # Data Model
 This section describes the data model that LUSID exposes via the APIs.
 ## Schema
 A detailed description of the entities used by the API and parameters for endpoints which take a JSON document can be retrieved via the `schema` endpoint.
 ## Securities
 LUSID has its own security master implementation (LUSID CORE) which sources reference data from multiple data vendors.
 [OpenFIGI](https://openfigi.com/) and [PermID](https://permid.org/) are used as the security identifier when uploading trades, holdings, prices, etc.
 The API exposes a `securities/lookup` endpoint which can be used to lookup these identifiers given other market identifiers.
 Cash can be referenced using the ISO currency code prefixed with "`CCY_`" e.g. `CCY_GBP`
 For any securities that are not recognised by LUSID (eg OTCs) a client can upload a client defined security. Securitised portfolios and funds can be modelled as client defined securities.
 ## Security Prices (Analytics)
 Security prices are stored in LUSID's Analytics Store
 ## Security Data
 Security data can be uploaded to the system using the [Classifications](#tag/Classification) endpoint.
 ## Portfolio
 A portfolio is a container for trades and/or holdings.  Meta data and classifications of portfolios can be attached via properties.
 ## Derived Portfolio
 LUSID also allows for a portfolio to be composed of another portfolio via derived portfolios.  A derived portfolio can contain its own trades and also inherits any trades from its parent portfolio.  Any changes made to the parent portfolio are automatically reflected in derived portfolio.
 Derived portfolios in conjunction with scopes are a powerful construct.  For example, to do pre-trade what-if analysis, a derived portfolio could be created a new namespace linked to the underlying live (parent) portfolio.  Analysis can then be undertaken on the derived portfolio without affecting the live portfolio.
 ## Transaction
 A transaction represents an economic activity against a Portfolio.
 | Field|Type|Description |
 | ---|---|--- |
 | TradeId|String|Unique trade identifier |
 | Type|TransactionType|LUSID transaction type code - Buy, Sell, StockIn, StockOut, etc |
 | SecurityUid|SecurityUid|Unique security identifier |
 | TradeDate|DateTimeOffset|Trade date |
 | SettlementDate|DateTimeOffset|Settlement date |
 | Units|Decimal|Quantity of trade in units of the security |
 | TradePrice|Decimal|Execution price for the trade |
 | TotalConsideration|Decimal|Total value of the trade |
 | SettlementCurrency|String|Settlement currency |
 | CounterpartyId|String|Counterparty identifier |
 | Source|TradeSource|Where this trade came from, either Client or System |
 | DividendState|DividendState|  |
 | TradePriceType|TradePriceType|  |
 | UnitType|UnitType|  |
 | NettingSet|String|  |
 ## Holding
 A holding represents a position in a security or cash on a given date.
 ## Property
 Properties are key-value pairs that can be applied to any entity within a domain (where a domain is `trade`, `portfolio`, `security` etc).  Properties must be defined before use with a `PropertyDefinition` and can then subsequently be added to entities.
