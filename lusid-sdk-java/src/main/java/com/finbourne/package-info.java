/**
 * This package contains the classes for LUSIDAPI.
 * # Introduction
 This page documents the [LUSID APIs](https://api.finbourne.com/swagger), which allows authorised clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.
 SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following languages :
 * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp)
 * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java)
 * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js)
 * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python)
 # Data Model
 The LUSID API has a relatively lightweight but extremely powerful data model.   One of the goals of LUSID was not to enforce on clients a single rigid data model but rather to provide a flexible foundation onto which clients can streamline their data.   One of the primary tools to extend the data model is through using properties.  Properties can be associated with amongst others: -
 * Trades
 * Securities
 * Portfolios
 The LUSID data model is exposed through the LUSID APIs.  The APIs provide access to both business objects and the meta data used to configure the systems behaviours.   The key business entities are: -
 * **Portfolios**
 A portfolio is the primary container for trades and holdings.
 * **Derived Portfolios**
 Derived portfolios allow portfolios to be created based on other portfolios, by overriding or overlaying specific items
 * **Holdings**
 A holding is a position account for a security within a portfolio.  Holdings can only be adjusted via transactions.
 * **Trades**
 A Trade is a source of transactions used to manipulate holdings.
 * **Corporate Actions**
 A corporate action is a market event which occurs to a security, for example a stock split
 * **Securities**
 A security represents a currency, tradable instrument or OTC contract that is attached to a transaction and a holding.
 * **Properties**
 Several entities allow additional user defined properties to be associated with them.   For example, a Portfolio manager may be associated with a portfolio
 Meta data includes: -
 * **Transaction Types**
 Trades are booked with a specific transaction type.  The types are client defined and are used to map the Trade to a series of movements which update the portfolio holdings.
 * **Properties Types**
 Types of user defined properties used within the system.
 This section describes the data model that LUSID exposes via the APIs.
 ## Scope
 All data in LUSID is segregated at the client level.  Entities in LUSID are identifiable by a unique code.  Every entity lives within a logical data partition known as a Scope.  Scope is an identity namespace allowing two entities with the same unique code to co-exist within individual address spaces.
 For example, prices for equities from different vendors may be uploaded into different scopes such as `client/vendor1` and `client/vendor2`.  A portfolio may then be valued using either of the price sources by referencing the appropriate scope.
 LUSID Clients cannot access scopes of other clients.
 ## Schema
 A detailed description of the entities used by the API and parameters for endpoints which take a JSON document can be retrieved via the `schema` endpoint.
 ## Securities
 LUSID has its own security master implementation (LUSID CORE) which sources reference data from multiple data vendors.
 [OpenFIGI](https://openfigi.com/) and [PermID](https://permid.org/) are used as the security identifier when uploading trades, holdings, prices, etc.
 The API exposes a `securities/lookup` endpoint which can be used to lookup these identifiers given other market identifiers.
 Cash can be referenced using the ISO currency code prefixed with "`CCY_`" e.g. `CCY_GBP`
 For any securities that are not recognised by LUSID (eg OTCs) a client can upload a client defined security. Securitised portfolios and funds can be modelled as client defined securities.
 ## Security Prices (Analytics)
 Security prices are stored in LUSID's Analytics Store
 | Field|Type|Description |
 | ---|---|--- |
 | Id|string|Unique security identifier |
 | Value|decimal|Value of the analytic, eg price |
 | Denomination|string|Underlying unit of the analytic, eg currency, EPS etc. |
 ## Security Data
 Security data can be uploaded to the system using the [Classifications](#tag/Classification) endpoint.
 | Field|Type|Description |
 | ---|---|--- |
 | Uid|string|Unique security identifier |
 ## Portfolios
 Portfolios are the top-level entity containers within LUSID, containing trades, corporate actions and holdings.    The transactions build up the portfolio holdings on which valuations, analytics profit & loss and risk can be calculated.
 Properties can be associated with Portfolios to add in additional model data.  Portfolio properties can be changed over time as well.  For example, to allow a Portfolio Manager to be linked with a Portfolio.
 Additionally, portfolios can be securitised and held by other portfolios, allowing LUSID to perform "drill-through" into underlying fund holdings
 ### Reference Portfolios
 Reference portfolios are portfolios that contain only holdings or weights, as opposed to transactions, and are designed to represent entities such as indices.
 ### Derived Portfolios
 LUSID also allows for a portfolio to be composed of another portfolio via derived portfolios.  A derived portfolio can contain its own trades and also inherits any trades from its parent portfolio.  Any changes made to the parent portfolio are automatically reflected in derived portfolio.
 Derived portfolios in conjunction with scopes are a powerful construct.  For example, to do pre-trade what-if analysis, a derived portfolio could be created a new namespace linked to the underlying live (parent) portfolio.  Analysis can then be undertaken on the derived portfolio without affecting the live portfolio.
 ### Portfolio Groups
 Portfolio groups allow the construction of a hierarchy from portfolios and groups.  Portfolio operations on the group are executed on an aggregated set of portfolios in the hierarchy.
 For example:
 * Global Portfolios _(group)_
   * APAC _(group)_
     * Hong Kong _(portfolio)_
     * Japan _(portfolio)_
   * Europe _(group)_
     * France _(portfolio)_
     * Germany _(portfolio)_
   * UK _(portfolio)_
 In this example **Global Portfolios** is a group that consists of an aggregate of **Hong Kong**, **Japan**, **France**, **Germany** and **UK** portfolios.
 ### Movements Engine
 The Movements engine sits on top of the immutable event store and is used to manage the relationship between input trading actions and their associated portfolio holdings.
 The movements engine reads in the following entity types:-
 * Posting Trades
 * Applying Corporate Actions
 * Holding Adjustments
 These are converted to one or more movements and used by the movements engine to calculate holdings.  At the same time it also calculates running balances, and realised P&L.  The outputs from the movements engine are holdings and transactions.
 ## Transactions
 A transaction represents an economic activity against a Portfolio.
 | Field|Type|Description |
 | ---|---|--- |
 | TradeId|string|Unique trade identifier |
 | Type|string|LUSID transaction type code - Buy, Sell, StockIn, StockOut, etc |
 | SecurityUid|string|Unique security identifier |
 | TradeDate|datetime|Trade date |
 | SettlementDate|datetime|Settlement date |
 | Units|decimal|Quantity of trade in units of the security |
 | TradePrice|decimal|Execution price for the trade |
 | TotalConsideration|decimal|Total value of the trade |
 | ExchangeRate|decimal|Rate between trade and settle currency |
 | SettlementCurrency|string|Settlement currency |
 | TradeCurrency|string|Trade currency |
 | CounterpartyId|string|Counterparty identifier |
 | Source|string|Where this trade came from, either Client or System |
 | DividendState|string|  |

 ## Holdings
 A holding represents a position in a security or cash on a given date.

 | Cost|decimal|Book cost of holding in trade currency |
 | CostPortfolioCcy|decimal|Book cost of holding in portfolio currency |
 | Transaction|TradeDto|If this is commitment-type holding, the transaction behind it |
 ## Corporate Actions
 Corporate actions are represented within LUSID in terms of a set of security-specific 'transitions'.  These transitions are used to specify the participants of the corporate action, and the effect that the corporate action will have on holdings in those participants.
 *Corporate action*
 | Field|Type|Description |
 | ---|---|--- |
 | SourceId|id|  |
 | CorporateActionId|code|  |
 | AnnouncementDate|datetime|  |

 | Direction|string|  |
 | SecurityUid|string|  |
 | UnitsFactor|decimal|  |
 | CostFactor|decimal|  |
 ## Property
 Properties are key-value pairs that can be applied to any entity within a domain (where a domain is `trade`, `portfolio`, `security` etc).  Properties must be defined before use with a `PropertyDefinition` and can then subsequently be added to entities.
